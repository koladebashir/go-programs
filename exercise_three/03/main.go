// Write a program that defines a struct called Employee with three fields:
// firstName, lastName, and id. The first two fields are of type string, and the
// last field (id) is of type int. Create three instances of this struct using whatever
// values youâ€™d like. Initialize the first one using the struct literal style without
// names, the second using the struct literal style with names, and the third with a
// var declaration. Use dot notation to populate the fields in the third struct. Print out all three structs.

func main() {
	type Employee struct {
		firstName string
		lastName string
		id int
	}

	employeeOne := Employee{
		id: 1,
	}
	employeeTwo := Employee{
		firstName: "Jack",
		lastName: "Meyers",
	}

	var employeeThree Employee
	employeeThree.firstName = "May"
	employeeThree.lastName = "Weather"
	employeeThree.id = 3

	fmt.Println(employeeOne, employeeTwo, employeeThree)
